NS-3 assignment of the 'Wireless Networking' course at TU Delft, by J.L.F. Betting, student nr 4016513

The C++ files (located in the 'scratch' folder) contain several variables that can be changed by adding arguments at execution and compilation. Execute the files with thae --printHelp argument to obtain more information about this.
The .sh script should be placed directly in the ns-3.24 directory, the .cc files go into the scratch folder.
The MATLAB files (located in the 'MATLAB' folder) were solely used for generating plots from the output files generated by the NS3 programmes, but in order to reproduce the results, one should take care that the variables, which can be find on the top of the file, are configured correctly.
